abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of visual motion estimation (visual odometry) from a single vehicle mounted camera. One of the basic issues of visual odometry is relative scale estimation. We propose a method to compute the relative scales of a path by solving a bundle adjustment optimization problem. We introduce a constricted parameterization of the bundle adjustment problem, where only the distances between neighboring cameras are optimized, while the rotation angles and translation directions stay fixed. We will present visual odometry results for image data of a vehicle mounted onmidirectional camera for a track of 1000m length.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: A Robot Scientist is a physically implemented robotic system that can automatically carry out cycles of scientific experimentation. We are commissioning a new Robot Scientist designed to investigate gene function in S. cerevisiae. This Robot Scientist will be capable of initiating >1,000 experiments, and making >200,000 observations a day. Robot Scientists provide a unique test bed for the development of methodologies for the curation and annotation of scientific experiments: because the experiments are conceived and executed automatically by computer, it is possible to completely capture and digitally curate all aspects of the scientific process. This new ability brings with it significant technical challenges. To meet these we apply an ontology driven approach to the representation of all the Robot Scientist's data and metadata.

RESULTS: We demonstrate the utility of developing an ontology for our new Robot Scientist. This ontology is based on a general ontology of experiments. The ontology aids the curation and annotating of the experimental data and metadata, and the equipment metadata, and supports the design of database systems to hold the data and metadata.

AVAILABILITY: EXPO in XML and OWL formats is at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/expo/. All materials about the Robot Scientist project are available at: http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/Research/bio/robotsci/.},

@article{VandeSande2010,
abstract = {Image category recognition is important to access visual information on the level of objects and scene types. So far, intensity-based descriptors have been widely used for feature extraction at salient points. To increase illumination invariance and discriminative power, color descriptors have been proposed. Because many different descriptors exist, a structured overview is required of color invariant descriptors in the context of image category recognition. Therefore, this paper studies the invariance properties and the distinctiveness of color descriptors (software to compute the color descriptors from this paper is available from http://www.colordescriptors.com) in a structured way. The analytical invariance properties of color descriptors are explored, using a taxonomy based on invariance properties with respect to photometric transformations, and tested experimentally using a data set with known illumination conditions. In addition, the distinctiveness of color descriptors is assessed experimentally using two benchmarks, one from the image domain and one from the video domain. From the theoretical and experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light intensity changes and light color changes affects category recognition. The results further reveal that, for light intensity shifts, the usefulness of invariance is category-specific. Overall, when choosing a single descriptor and no prior knowledge about the data set and object and scene categories is available, the OpponentSIFT is recommended. Furthermore, a combined set of color descriptors outperforms intensity-based SIFT and improves category recognition by 8 percent on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and by 7 percent on the Mediamill Challenge.},

@article{Kormushev2013,
abstract = {In robotics, the ultimate goal of reinforcement learning is to endow robots with the ability to learn, improve, adapt and reproduce tasks with dynamically changing constraints based on exploration and autonomous learning. We give a summary of the state-of-the-art of reinforcement learning in the context of robotics, in terms of both algorithms and policy representations. Numerous challenges faced by the policy representation in robotics are identified. Three recent examples for the application of reinforcement learning to real-world robots are described: a pancake flipping task, a bipedal walking energy minimization task and an archery-based aiming task. In all examples, a state-of-the-art expectation-maximization-based reinforcement learning is used, and different policy representations are proposed and evaluated for each task. The proposed policy representations offer viable solutions to six rarely-addressed challenges in policy representations: correlations, adaptability, multi-resolution, globality, multi-dimensionality and convergence. Both the successes and the practical difficulties encountered in these examples are discussed. Based on insights from these particular cases, conclusions are drawn about the state-of-the-art and the future perspective directions for reinforcement learning in robotics.},

@article{Gamal2010,
abstract = {Network information theory deals with the fundamental limits on information flow in networks and optimal coding techniques and protocols that achieve these limits. It extends Shannon's point-to-point information theory and the Ford-Fulkerson max-flow min-cut theorem to networks with multiple sources and destinations, broadcasting, interference, relaying, distributed compression and computing. Although a complete theory is yet to be developed, several beautiful results and techniques have been developed over the past forty years with potential applications in wireless communication, the Internet, and other networked systems. This set of lecture notes, which is a much expanded version of lecture notes used in graduate courses over the past eight years at Stanford, UCSD, CUHK, UC Berkeley, and EPFL, aims to provide a broad coverage of key results, techniques, and open problems in network information theory. The lectures are organized into four parts: background, single-hop networks, multi-hop networks, and extensions. The organization attempts to balance the introduction of new techniques and new models. Extensions (if any) to many users and large networks are discussed throughout. The lecture notes provide a unified, simplified, and formalized treatment of achievability using a few basic lemmas. The proofs in the lecture notes use elementary tools and techniques, which should make them accessible to graduate students in EE, CS, Statistics, and related fields as well as to researchers and practitioners in industry.},

abstract = {Visual odometry is a new navigation technology using video data. For long-range navigation, an intrinsic problem of visual odometry is the appearance of drift. The drift is caused by error accumulation, as visual odometry is based on relative measurements, and will grow unboundedly with time. The paper first reviews algorithms which adopt various methods to suppress this drift. However, as far as we know, no work has been done to statistically model and analyze the intrinsic properties of this drift. This paper uses an unbounded system model to represent the drift behavior of visual odometry. The model is composed of an unbounded deterministic part with unknown constant parameters, and a first-order Gauss-Markov process. A simple scheme is given to identify the unknown parameters as well as the statistics of the stochastic part from experimental data. Experiments and discussions are also provided.},

abstract = {Characterized bacteria, unlike eukaryotes and some archaea, initiate replication bidirectionally from a single replication origin contained within a circular or linear chromosome. We constructed Escherichia coli cells with two WT origins separated by 1 Mb in their 4.64-Mb chromosome. Productive bidirectional replication initiated synchronously at both spatially separate origins. Newly replicated DNA from both origins was segregated sequentially as replication progressed, with two temporally and spatially separate replication termination events. Replication initiation occurred at a cell volume identical to that of cells with a single WT origin, showing that initiation control is independent of cellular and chromosomal oriC concentration. Cells containing just the ectopic origin initiated bidirectional replication at the expected cell mass and at the normal cellular location of that region. In all strains, spatial separation of sister loci adjacent to active origins occurred shortly after their replication, independently of whether replication initiated at the normal origin, the ectopic origin, or both origins.},

@article{Gao2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chromosomal replication is the central event in the bacterial cell cycle. Identification of replication origins (oriCs) is necessary for almost all newly sequenced bacterial genomes. Given the increasing pace of genome sequencing, the current available software for predicting oriCs, however, still leaves much to be desired. Therefore, the increasing availability of genome sequences calls for improved software to identify oriCs in newly sequenced and unannotated bacterial genomes.

RESULTS: We have developed Ori-Finder, an online system for finding oriCs in bacterial genomes based on an integrated method comprising the analysis of base composition asymmetry using the Z-curve method, distribution of DnaA boxes, and the occurrence of genes frequently close to oriCs. The program can also deal with unannotated genome sequences by integrating the gene-finding program ZCURVE 1.02. Output of the predicted results is exported to an HTML report, which offers convenient views on the results in both graphical and tabular formats.

CONCLUSION: A web-based system to predict replication origins of bacterial genomes has been presented here. Based on this system, oriC regions have been predicted for the bacterial genomes available in GenBank currently. It is hoped that Ori-Finder will become a useful tool for the identification and analysis of oriCs in both bacterial and archaeal genomes.},

abstract = {The Plasmodium falciparum genome being AT-rich, the presence of GC-rich regions suggests functional significance. Evolution imposes selection pressure to retain functionally important coding and regulatory elements. Hence searching for evolutionarily conserved GC-rich, intergenic regions in an AT-rich genome will help in discovering new coding regions and regulatory elements. We have used elevated GC content in intergenic regions coupled with sequence conservation against P. reichenowi, which is evolutionarily closely related to P. falciparum to identify potential sequences of functional importance. Interestingly, \~{}30\% of the GC-rich, conserved sequences were associated with antigenic proteins encoded by var and rifin genes. The majority of sequences identified in the 5' UTR of var genes are represented by short expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in cDNA libraries signifying that they are transcribed in the parasite. Additionally, 19 sequences were located in the 3' UTR of rifins and 4 also have overlapping ESTs. Further analysis showed that several sequences associated with var genes have the capacity to encode small peptides. A previous report has shown that upstream peptides can regulate the expression of var genes hence we propose that these conserved GC-rich sequences may play roles in regulation of gene expression.},

abstract = {A curvature-adaptive implicit surface reconstruction for noisy and irregularly spaced points in 3-D is introduced. The reconstructed surface traces the zero-crossings of a signed field obtained from the sum of first-derivative anisotropic Gaussians centered at the points. The standard deviations of the anisotropic Gaussians are adapted to surface curvatures estimated from local data. A key characteristic of the formulation is its ability to smooth more along edges than across them, thereby preserving shape details while smoothing noise. The behavior of the proposed method under various density and organization of points is investigated and surface reconstruction results are compared with those obtained by well-known methods in the literature.},

abstract = {FORS-D is a measure of the contribution of base order to the stem loop potential of a nucleic acid sequence and can also give information on evolutionary pressures on sequences to move away from secondary structure. Negative FORS-D values in a gene are associated with exons and nucleotide substitutions such as SNPs. An analysis of P. falciparum genes under selection pressure shows a correlation between negative FORS-D values and SNP density for genes that drug targets but not for drug transporters or antigenic variation genes. Analysis of the dhfr gene shows that a majority of rare mutations that associate with drug resistance also fall into regions with negative FORS-D values. These data suggest that FORS-D values might be predictors for drug target genes and drug resistance mutations in these genes.},

@article{Shannon2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systems biologists work with many kinds of data, from many different sources, using a variety of software tools. Each of these tools typically excels at one type of analysis, such as of microarrays, of metabolic networks and of predicted protein structure. A crucial challenge is to combine the capabilities of these (and other forthcoming) data resources and tools to create a data exploration and analysis environment that does justice to the variety and complexity of systems biology data sets. A solution to this problem should recognize that data types, formats and software in this high throughput age of biology are constantly changing.

RESULTS: In this paper we describe the Gaggle -a simple, open-source Java software environment that helps to solve the problem of software and database integration. Guided by the classic software engineering strategy of separation of concerns and a policy of semantic flexibility, it integrates existing popular programs and web resources into a user-friendly, easily-extended environment. We demonstrate that four simple data types (names, matrices, networks, and associative arrays) are sufficient to bring together diverse databases and software. We highlight some capabilities of the Gaggle with an exploration of Helicobacter pylori pathogenesis genes, in which we identify a putative ricin-like protein -a discovery made possible by simultaneous data exploration using a wide range of publicly available data and a variety of popular bioinformatics software tools.

CONCLUSION: We have integrated diverse databases (for example, KEGG, BioCyc, String) and software (Cytoscape, DataMatrixViewer, R statistical environment, and TIGR Microarray Expression Viewer). Through this loose coupling of diverse software and databases the Gaggle enables simultaneous exploration of experimental data (mRNA and protein abundance, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions), functional associations (operon, chromosomal proximity, phylogenetic pattern), metabolic pathways (KEGG) and Pubmed abstracts (STRING web resource), creating an exploratory environment useful to 'web browser and spreadsheet biologists', to statistically savvy computational biologists, and those in between. The Gaggle uses Java RMI and Java Web Start technologies and can be found at http://gaggle.systemsbiology.net.},

The subject is not usually discussed explicitly within our profession. Scientists are expected to be smart enough to figure it out on their own and through the observation of their teachers. This lack of explicit discussion leaves a vacuum that can lead to approaches such as choosing problems that can give results that merit publication in valued journals, resulting in a job and tenure.},
