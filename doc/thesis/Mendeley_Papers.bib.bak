	odometry) from a single vehicle mounted camera. One of the basic
	issues of visual odometry is relative scale estimation. We propose
	a method to compute the relative scales of a path by solving a bundle
	adjustment optimization problem. We introduce a constricted parameterization
	of the bundle adjustment problem, where only the distances between
	neighboring cameras are optimized, while the rotation angles and
	translation directions stay fixed. We will present visual odometry
	results for image data of a vehicle mounted onmidirectional camera
	for a track of 1000m length.},

  abstract = {Network information theory deals with the fundamental limits on information
	flow in networks and optimal coding techniques and protocols that
	achieve these limits. It extends Shannon's point-to-point information
	theory and the Ford-Fulkerson max-flow min-cut theorem to networks
	with multiple sources and destinations, broadcasting, interference,
	relaying, distributed compression and computing. Although a complete
	theory is yet to be developed, several beautiful results and techniques
	have been developed over the past forty years with potential applications
	in wireless communication, the Internet, and other networked systems.
	This set of lecture notes, which is a much expanded version of lecture
	notes used in graduate courses over the past eight years at Stanford,
	UCSD, CUHK, UC Berkeley, and EPFL, aims to provide a broad coverage
	of key results, techniques, and open problems in network information
	theory. The lectures are organized into four parts: background, single-hop
	networks, multi-hop networks, and extensions. The organization attempts
	to balance the introduction of new techniques and new models. Extensions
	(if any) to many users and large networks are discussed throughout.
	The lecture notes provide a unified, simplified, and formalized treatment
	of achievability using a few basic lemmas. The proofs in the lecture
	notes use elementary tools and techniques, which should make them
	accessible to graduate students in EE, CS, Statistics, and related
	fields as well as to researchers and practitioners in industry.},

  title = {{Ori-Finder: a web-based system for finding oriCs in unannotated
	bacterial genomes.}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chromosomal replication is the central event in the bacterial
	cell cycle. Identification of replication origins (oriCs) is necessary
	for almost all newly sequenced bacterial genomes. Given the increasing
	pace of genome sequencing, the current available software for predicting
	oriCs, however, still leaves much to be desired. Therefore, the increasing
	availability of genome sequences calls for improved software to identify
	oriCs in newly sequenced and unannotated bacterial genomes.
	
	RESULTS: We have developed Ori-Finder, an online system for finding
	oriCs in bacterial genomes based on an integrated method comprising
	the analysis of base composition asymmetry using the Z-curve method,
	distribution of DnaA boxes, and the occurrence of genes frequently
	close to oriCs. The program can also deal with unannotated genome
	sequences by integrating the gene-finding program ZCURVE 1.02. Output
	of the predicted results is exported to an HTML report, which offers
	convenient views on the results in both graphical and tabular formats.
	
	CONCLUSION: A web-based system to predict replication origins of bacterial
	genomes has been presented here. Based on this system, oriC regions
	have been predicted for the bacterial genomes available in GenBank
	currently. It is hoped that Ori-Finder will become a useful tool
	for the identification and analysis of oriCs in both bacterial and
	archaeal genomes.},

  abstract = {Visual odometry is a new navigation technology using video data. For
	long-range navigation, an intrinsic problem of visual odometry is
	the appearance of drift. The drift is caused by error accumulation,
	as visual odometry is based on relative measurements, and will grow
	unboundedly with time. The paper first reviews algorithms which adopt
	various methods to suppress this drift. However, as far as we know,
	no work has been done to statistically model and analyze the intrinsic
	properties of this drift. This paper uses an unbounded system model
	to represent the drift behavior of visual odometry. The model is
	composed of an unbounded deterministic part with unknown constant
	parameters, and a first-order Gauss-Markov process. A simple scheme
	is given to identify the unknown parameters as well as the statistics
	of the stochastic part from experimental data. Experiments and discussions
	are also provided.},

  abstract = {FORS-D is a measure of the contribution of base order to the stem
	loop potential of a nucleic acid sequence and can also give information
	on evolutionary pressures on sequences to move away from secondary
	structure. Negative FORS-D values in a gene are associated with exons
	and nucleotide substitutions such as SNPs. An analysis of P. falciparum
	genes under selection pressure shows a correlation between negative
	FORS-D values and SNP density for genes that drug targets but not
	for drug transporters or antigenic variation genes. Analysis of the
	dhfr gene shows that a majority of rare mutations that associate
	with drug resistance also fall into regions with negative FORS-D
	values. These data suggest that FORS-D values might be predictors
	for drug target genes and drug resistance mutations in these genes.},

  abstract = {In robotics, the ultimate goal of reinforcement learning is to endow
	robots with the ability to learn, improve, adapt and reproduce tasks
	with dynamically changing constraints based on exploration and autonomous
	learning. We give a summary of the state-of-the-art of reinforcement
	learning in the context of robotics, in terms of both algorithms
	and policy representations. Numerous challenges faced by the policy
	representation in robotics are identified. Three recent examples
	for the application of reinforcement learning to real-world robots
	are described: a pancake flipping task, a bipedal walking energy
	minimization task and an archery-based aiming task. In all examples,
	a state-of-the-art expectation-maximization-based reinforcement learning
	is used, and different policy representations are proposed and evaluated
	for each task. The proposed policy representations offer viable solutions
	to six rarely-addressed challenges in policy representations: correlations,
	adaptability, multi-resolution, globality, multi-dimensionality and
	convergence. Both the successes and the practical difficulties encountered
	in these examples are discussed. Based on insights from these particular
	cases, conclusions are drawn about the state-of-the-art and the future
	perspective directions for reinforcement learning in robotics.},

  abstract = {The Plasmodium falciparum genome being AT-rich, the presence of GC-rich
	regions suggests functional significance. Evolution imposes selection
	pressure to retain functionally important coding and regulatory elements.
	Hence searching for evolutionarily conserved GC-rich, intergenic
	regions in an AT-rich genome will help in discovering new coding
	regions and regulatory elements. We have used elevated GC content
	in intergenic regions coupled with sequence conservation against
	P. reichenowi, which is evolutionarily closely related to P. falciparum
	to identify potential sequences of functional importance. Interestingly,
	\~{}30\% of the GC-rich, conserved sequences were associated with
	antigenic proteins encoded by var and rifin genes. The majority of
	sequences identified in the 5' UTR of var genes are represented by
	short expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in cDNA libraries signifying
	that they are transcribed in the parasite. Additionally, 19 sequences
	were located in the 3' UTR of rifins and 4 also have overlapping
	ESTs. Further analysis showed that several sequences associated with
	var genes have the capacity to encode small peptides. A previous
	report has shown that upstream peptides can regulate the expression
	of var genes hence we propose that these conserved GC-rich sequences
	may play roles in regulation of gene expression.},

  abstract = {Image category recognition is important to access visual information
	on the level of objects and scene types. So far, intensity-based
	descriptors have been widely used for feature extraction at salient
	points. To increase illumination invariance and discriminative power,
	color descriptors have been proposed. Because many different descriptors
	exist, a structured overview is required of color invariant descriptors
	in the context of image category recognition. Therefore, this paper
	studies the invariance properties and the distinctiveness of color
	descriptors (software to compute the color descriptors from this
	paper is available from http://www.colordescriptors.com) in a structured
	way. The analytical invariance properties of color descriptors are
	explored, using a taxonomy based on invariance properties with respect
	to photometric transformations, and tested experimentally using a
	data set with known illumination conditions. In addition, the distinctiveness
	of color descriptors is assessed experimentally using two benchmarks,
	one from the image domain and one from the video domain. From the
	theoretical and experimental results, it can be derived that invariance
	to light intensity changes and light color changes affects category
	recognition. The results further reveal that, for light intensity
	shifts, the usefulness of invariance is category-specific. Overall,
	when choosing a single descriptor and no prior knowledge about the
	data set and object and scene categories is available, the OpponentSIFT
	is recommended. Furthermore, a combined set of color descriptors
	outperforms intensity-based SIFT and improves category recognition
	by 8 percent on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and by 7 percent on the Mediamill
	Challenge.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systems biologists work with many kinds of data, from
	many different sources, using a variety of software tools. Each of
	these tools typically excels at one type of analysis, such as of
	microarrays, of metabolic networks and of predicted protein structure.
	A crucial challenge is to combine the capabilities of these (and
	other forthcoming) data resources and tools to create a data exploration
	and analysis environment that does justice to the variety and complexity
	of systems biology data sets. A solution to this problem should recognize
	that data types, formats and software in this high throughput age
	of biology are constantly changing.
	
	RESULTS: In this paper we describe the Gaggle -a simple, open-source
	Java software environment that helps to solve the problem of software
	and database integration. Guided by the classic software engineering
	strategy of separation of concerns and a policy of semantic flexibility,
	it integrates existing popular programs and web resources into a
	user-friendly, easily-extended environment. We demonstrate that four
	simple data types (names, matrices, networks, and associative arrays)
	are sufficient to bring together diverse databases and software.
	We highlight some capabilities of the Gaggle with an exploration
	of Helicobacter pylori pathogenesis genes, in which we identify a
	putative ricin-like protein -a discovery made possible by simultaneous
	data exploration using a wide range of publicly available data and
	a variety of popular bioinformatics software tools.
	
	CONCLUSION: We have integrated diverse databases (for example, KEGG,
	BioCyc, String) and software (Cytoscape, DataMatrixViewer, R statistical
	environment, and TIGR Microarray Expression Viewer). Through this
	loose coupling of diverse software and databases the Gaggle enables
	simultaneous exploration of experimental data (mRNA and protein abundance,
	protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions), functional associations
	(operon, chromosomal proximity, phylogenetic pattern), metabolic
	pathways (KEGG) and Pubmed abstracts (STRING web resource), creating
	an exploratory environment useful to 'web browser and spreadsheet
	biologists', to statistically savvy computational biologists, and
	those in between. The Gaggle uses Java RMI and Java Web Start technologies
	and can be found at http://gaggle.systemsbiology.net.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: A Robot Scientist is a physically implemented robotic
	system that can automatically carry out cycles of scientific experimentation.
	We are commissioning a new Robot Scientist designed to investigate
	gene function in S. cerevisiae. This Robot Scientist will be capable
	of initiating >1,000 experiments, and making >200,000 observations
	a day. Robot Scientists provide a unique test bed for the development
	of methodologies for the curation and annotation of scientific experiments:
	because the experiments are conceived and executed automatically
	by computer, it is possible to completely capture and digitally curate
	all aspects of the scientific process. This new ability brings with
	it significant technical challenges. To meet these we apply an ontology
	driven approach to the representation of all the Robot Scientist's
	data and metadata.
	
	RESULTS: We demonstrate the utility of developing an ontology for
	our new Robot Scientist. This ontology is based on a general ontology
	of experiments. The ontology aids the curation and annotating of
	the experimental data and metadata, and the equipment metadata, and
	supports the design of database systems to hold the data and metadata.
	
	AVAILABILITY: EXPO in XML and OWL formats is at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/expo/.
	All materials about the Robot Scientist project are available at:

	containing just the ectopic origin initiated bidirectional replication
	at the expected cell mass and at the normal cellular location of

  abstract = {A curvature-adaptive implicit surface reconstruction for noisy and
	irregularly spaced points in 3-D is introduced. The reconstructed
	surface traces the zero-crossings of a signed field obtained from
	the sum of first-derivative anisotropic Gaussians centered at the
	points. The standard deviations of the anisotropic Gaussians are
	adapted to surface curvatures estimated from local data. A key characteristic
	of the formulation is its ability to smooth more along edges than
	across them, thereby preserving shape details while smoothing noise.
